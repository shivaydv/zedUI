### ✨ What Makes Zed UI Different

Zed UI is built on principles that matter to modern developers:

- **Design That Stands Out**  
  Each component is built to look polished out of the box — clean typography, balanced spacing, and visual harmony that fits into any product.

- **Copy, Paste, Ship**  
  Grab the components you need, customize them instantly, and stay in full control. You own the code — no hidden magic or framework lock-ins.

- **Customizable by Default**  
  Easily adjust colors, fonts, and layouts with CSS variables or utility classes. Everything is modular and easy to adapt to your design system.

- **Engineer-Friendly**  
  Zed UI is made with engineers in mind — no fiddling with design tools or hunting for style tokens. It just works.

- **Clear, Practical Docs**  
  Every component includes usage examples, and copy-paste code. Spend less time guessing and more time building.
